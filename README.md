## Setup

In order to set this up, simply clone this repository into a local directory and point your browser of choice to the `index.html`.

## Affecting Data

In order to customize the data on your local page, you will need to create (or edit) a json file. A `sample.json` has been provided for you in the `data` directory. If you create a different file, you will need to update the script import in `index.html`.

## Chrome

To make everything play nice in Chrome, I would recommend installing a plugin called `New Tab Replace`. Configure this plugin to point to the `index.html`.
