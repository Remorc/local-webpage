## Setup

In order to set this up, simply clone this repository into a local directory and point your browser of choice to the `index.html`.

## Adding a column

If you want to add a column, but keep the same column sizes that already exist, you will want to adjust the multiplier on the width of html. See `index.css`.

## Chrome

To make everything play nice in Chrome, I would recommend installing a plugin called `New Tab Replace`. Configure this plugin to point to the `index.html`.
